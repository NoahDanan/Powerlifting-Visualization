# Powerlifting Visualization
Data science project for DSC 106 class at UCSD. It is a group project using data from a powerlifting dataset. My collaborators are Yujin Lee and Aile Banuelos.


We chose an interactive donut design to display powerlifters' average dot scores throughout the years. A dot score is a person's relative strength that can be compared to other genders and weight classes. We wanted to make it easy for people to shuffle through the years therefore we made the slider with dates. We originally had the plan of doing averages based on different countries but the idea of being able to see the United States throughout the years would be more informative than one year and multiple countries. With our data set it makes it easy to see how the average of powerlifter's dots progress throughout the years. We used the federation USAPL as using all federations would give us many weight classes that are too close to one another.

The way we started was by going through and cleaning up the data, Aile suggested the data set and used SQL to go through the original CSV file to cut it down, as well as helping cut out data. Noah had suggested our design to use, as well as implementing the website to allow for the data to be presented. Yujin helped with grouping the data with years to make it better for Noah to get it into the website. We each contributed equally and helped out each other as much as we could. The aspect that took the most time was getting the data to work with the website. Overall we spent the most time on getting the data to work with the visualization we wanted and brain storming how to go about it. One thing to take into consideration with this data set is that both non-tested lifters and equipped lifters are contributing to the average. Non-tested federations normally have lifters who are enhanced by drug usage aka steroids etc. Equipped lifters are people who use equipment that helps get their dot score higher by lifting more weight. This allows us to assume that the averages are higher than they would be if we had just used raw lifters (which is the most common type of lifter).
